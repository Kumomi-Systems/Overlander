# Overlander

A simple tabletop battle simulator, built in Tauri and Vue.

## Getting Started
Run the relevant setup script in the `setup` directory to install the necessary tools for building Overlander. Linux install scripts will feature the name of the distro they are to be used on (or the base distro thereof, e.g. EndeavourOS users should use the Arch install script). The Windows install script requires the installation of [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget) and may require configuring [Powershell's Execution Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4#managing-the-execution-policy-with-powershell). Please note that Winget is only available on Windows 10 Version 1809 and above and comes pre-installed on Windows 11.

## Running Overlander
To start Overlander, run `npm run tauri dev` in the project's root directory.
